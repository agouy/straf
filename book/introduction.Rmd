In this chapter, we will briefly introduce some essential concepts in genetics.

## DNA and genetic variation {-}

Each of our cells contains 23 pairs of __chromosomes__, composed of a long __DNA__ 
(deoxyribonucleic acid) molecule. This molecule is the carrier of the information 
the body need for its function and development. This information is encoded by a 
chain of __nucleotides__ of four types that can be referred to using the letters
A (Adenine), T (Thymine), C (Cytosine) and G (Guanine).

Developments in biotechnologies enabled the characterisation of the DNA of
individuals. These techniques also led to the discovery that this DNA varies
between individuals. This __genetic variation__, also called __polymorphism__, 
can be used to characterise individuals and populations based on their DNA.

## Markers of polymorphism {-}

DNA variation can take different forms: it can for example be a 
__Single Nucleotide Polymorphism__ (**SNP**), when a mutation occurs and changes a
nucleotide at a given position in the genome. In that case, we would observe
different nucleotides in a population at a single position. 

There can also be __insertions__ and __deletions__ (sometimes referred to as
**InDels**), of one or multiple nucleotides.

Finally, other markers of genetic variation are __Copy Number Variants__ (**CNVs**), 
when a sequence is repeated a certain number of times. 
They can be composed of more or less repetitive units. These units can contain more or 
less nucleotides. __Short Tandem Repeats__ (**STRs**) are a type of genetic 
polymorphism consisting in short sequences from 2 to 7 base pairs that are 
repeated several times. The __number of repeats varies__ among individuals, therefore characterizing 
the length of those repeat regions can be useful to identify individuals. STRs are the most common markers used in forensic genetics.

## Polymorphism and forensics {-}

### DNA profiling and typing {-}

As DNA varies between individuals, DNA typing became a central element of the forensic
scientist toolkit. For example, typical questions forensic genetics aims at
answering include:

* What is the probability that a DNA profile at a crime scene does not only match the person of interest, but also a person picked randomly from the relevant population?

* Based on the detected genetic variants: Is it more likely to detect these combinations if the two persons of interest are brother and sister or if they are unrelated?


### The role of population genetics {-}

To answer these questions, it is crucial to first get a good characterisation 
of __genetic variant__ (or **allele**) frequencies in populations of interest,
at different __loci__ across the genome. Indeed, these frequencies can vary 
widely among populations.

In this context, STRAF has been designed to facilitate the analysis of 
__population data__ in forensic genetics.
