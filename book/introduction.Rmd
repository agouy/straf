# Introduction {-}

In this chapter, we will briefly introduce some essential concepts in genetics.

## DNA and genetic variation {-}

Each of our cells contains 23 pairs of __chromosomes__, composed of a long __DNA__ 
(deoxyribonucleic acid) molecule. Under this somewhat barbaric name
is hiding a simple concept. This molecule is the support of the information 
used by the body to function and development. This information is encoded by a 
chain of __nucleotides__ of four types that can be referred to using the letters
A (Adenine), T (Thymine), C (Cytosine) and G (Guanine).

Developments in biotechnologies enabled the ability to characterise the DNA of
individuals. These technologies also led to the discovery that this DNA varies
between individuals. This __genetic variation__, also called __polymorphism__, 
can be used to characterise individuals and populations based on their DNA.

## Markers of polymorphism {-}

DNA variation can take different forms: it can for example be a 
__Single Nucleotide Polymorphism__ (**SNP**), when a mutation occured and changed a
nucleotide at a given position in the genome. In that case, we would observe
different nucleotides in a population at a single position. 

There are also __insertions__ and __deletions__ (sometimes referred to as
**InDels**), of one or multiple nucleotides.

Finally, other markers of genetic variation are
__Copy Number Variants__ (**CNVs**), when a sequence is repeated a certain number
of times. They can be and contain more or less repetitive units.

__Short Tandem Repeats__ (**STRs**) a type of genetic polymorphism consisting
in short sequences from 2 to 7 base pairs that are repeated a certain number of time.
As the number of repeats varies among individuals, characterizing their 
length can be useful to identify individuals.

## Polymorphism and forensics {-}

### DNA profiling and typing {-}

As DNA varies between individuals, DNA typing became a central element of the forensic
scientist toolkit. For example, typical questions forensic genetics aims at
answering include:

* What is the probability that a randomly-picked person in a population would 
match the individual of interest in terms of DNA?

* Which proportion of the population has the same combination of
genetic variants as the sample of interest?

### The role of population genetics {-}

To answer these questions, it is crucial to first get a good characterisation 
of __genetic variants__ (or **alleles**) frequencies in populations of interest,
at different __loci__ across the genome. Indeed, these frequencies can vary 
widely among populations.

__Digression - Why STRs and not other markers?__

Comparing to whole-genome sequencing. They have a high __power of discrimination__
because they have a much higher diversity (their mutation rate is higher than
other common markers).

## STRAF and population data analysis {-}

In this context, STRAF has been designed to facilitate the analysis of 
__population data__ in forensic genetics.
