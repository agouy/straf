You have now reached the end of the STRAF Book. This book has been written to give
a broad overview of the concepts and tools you can find in the application. 
We hope it has been useful to you.

If you want to know more about STRAF, you will find more information about the
software in the __Appendix__ section.

You can now go back to [straf.fr](straf.fr) and use the application for your 
forensics project! Any feedback is always welcome and you can contact us anytime. 
STRAF is continuously improving thanks to your precious feedback!
