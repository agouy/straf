<p>This is the online version of <strong>The STRAF Book</strong>, which is currently under
active development. It is dedicated to the STRAF software, a web application
for the analysis of genetic data in forensic practice.</p>

</h2>
<p>Genetics has many faces, and forensic and population genetics are two of them.
If we were to summarise their respective scopes, we could say that the former
is the application of genetics to legal matters, and the latter aims at
understanding genetic differences within and between populations, a
fundamental matter in evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Forensic genetics and population genetics have always been tightly linked
disciplines. This is likely because quite a number of questions they address
are similar. Even though problems in forensics and population genetics seem
different, they often correspond to the same question, simply phrased differently.</p>
<p>For example, DNA profiling, used in criminal investigations or parental testing,
aims at matching different DNA samples and understanding how related they are in
terms of DNA. In population genetics, a common goal is to characterise the
genetic diversity of a set of populations, by looking at how related individuals
are within and between populations. Both fields aim at <strong>understanding</strong> and
<strong>quantifying</strong> the <strong>relatedness</strong> of individuals based on their DNA.</p>
<p>Software and metrics developed in the population genetics for the study of the
evolution of species are now used routinely in forensic genetics practice.
But forensics is not just <em>applied population genetics</em>. The legal implications
and unique situations encountered in the forensics world also led to the
development of relevant statistical tools and metrics with a more specific purpose.</p>

<h2>And then there was STRAF<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#and-then-there-was-straf"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>STRAF</strong> was born from the encounter of two scientists: a forensic geneticist and a
population geneticist, in 2017, in the beautiful city of Bern (Switzerland).
Martin came to visit a population genetics lab, where Alexandre was pursuing
his Ph.D. thesis at that time. This encounter led to a fruitful collaboration
when they realised that some tools used in population genetics could be
leveraged by the forensics community.</p>
<p>This encounter led to a fruitful collaboration when they realised that some tools
used in population genetics could be leveraged by the forensics community. The
most striking example is the computation of forensics parameters, that describe
for example how good are our loci at discriminating samples. These
parameters were typically computed using a spreadsheet that had been created by
one of the suppliers of assays used to genotype samples. It is the mythical
PowerStats v1.2 spreadsheet, allowing to compute forensic statistics and allele
frequencies in Microsoft Excel. It has been since then removed from the Internet,
and forensic geneticists started sharing this spreadsheet among each other, circulating
almost secretly, “under the cloak” as French speakers would say.</p>
<p>As similar operations were done in routine in population genetics, we already had
some scripts for the analysis of STR data. Then, after we applied them to an existing
dataset, we decided to put everything into a web application so that the forensics
community could benefit from it.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, STRAF was born, and after four year, STRAF had become a
widely used tool by the forensics community, but not only.
It has been used as a support for teaching population genetics, and has
been used in evolutionary biology studies.
The positive reception of the software in the community motivated its
development over the years until the release of STRAF 2.0 in 2021.</p>

<p>By reading this book, our hope is that you will:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get an overview of common <strong>concepts</strong> in forensic and population genetics</p></li>
<li><p>Learn how to use the <strong>STRAF software</strong> for STR data analysis through <strong>practical applications</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Be able to <strong>interpret</strong> common metrics and analyses used in forensics practice</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="outline" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Outline<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#outline"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The book is organised as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We’ll start by an <strong>Introduction</strong> to essential forensic and population genetics concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>Chapter 1</strong>, we will focus on data, from its generation to its preparation for
downstream analysis in STRAF.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>Chapter 2</strong>, we will review <strong>forensic parameters</strong> that can be computed in STRAF,
and discuss their interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>Chapter 3</strong>, we will review essential population genetics concepts and
describe <strong>population genetics indices</strong> that can be computed in STRAF.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>Chapter 4</strong>, we will focus on <strong>multivariate statistics</strong> and how they can provide
insights into population structure, with a particular focus on Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), two widely used approaches in genetics.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>Chapter 5</strong>, we gather recommendations around potential next analysis steps
by presenting STRAF’s <strong>file conversion</strong> capabilities and useful methods implemented in
<strong>other software</strong>.</p></li>
